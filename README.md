# Data-Analytics-Projects
Here are all the practise Data Analytics projects I have worked on using Power BI/Tableau/MS Excel.
'The Adventure Works' Power BI report and 'Maven Market' Power BI report are created by me as projects under course 'Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence' 
from Maven Analytics from Udemy.
'Zomato' report is created by me as a project under 'Data Analyst Master Program' from Simplilearn.
I used my learning, logical skills, and creativity to create these projects in line with objectives.
These projects includes Dashboards, KPIs, Visualizations, Measures to compare products, stores, financial years, profits, and performance for better decision making.
