# Data-Analytics-Projects
Here are all the practise Data Analytics projects I have worked on using Power BI/Tableau/MS Excel.

Power BI Projects

'The Adventure Works' Power BI report and 'Maven Market' Power BI report are created by me as projects under course 'Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence' 
from Maven Analytics from Udemy.

'Zomato' report is created by me as a project under 'Data Analyst Master Program' from Simplilearn.

I used my learning, logical skills, and creativity to create these projects in line with objectives.

These projects includes Dashboards, KPIs, Visualizations, Measures to compare products, stores, financial years, profits, and performance for better decision making.

MS Excel Projects

I have done three projects for MS Excel that are 'E Commerce Dashboard Project1', 'Predicting Tips', and 'Crime US Projects'. All three are projects under 'Data Analyst Master Program' from Simplilearn.

E Commerce Dashboard Project1 is done to create a dashboard for an e commerce company to show KPIs and Visualizations that are fully dynamic.

Predicting Tips project is done to predict tips at a restaurant based on variables like gender, number of diners, day of the week, etc.

Crime US Projects project is done to breakdown data using various statistical functions to find trends and patterns in data in order to make better decisions. Since, excel file was too big in size I have only attached screenshots compressed in a rar.
